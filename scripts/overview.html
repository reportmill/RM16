In fact, most developers   shouldn't need this JavaDoc documentation at all. Most developers will only   use the following two sets of API, documented completely in the Basic API document,   found on the <a href="http://reportmill.com/support">support page</a>.</p><p><strong>Generate XML Dataset</strong></p><p>This first step is optional, but to facilitate template design, it's handy   to have an XML description of your dataset. You can get this with a single line   of code:</p><p>new RMXMLWriter().writeObject(myObjects, &quot;MyDataset.xml&quot;);</p><p>Once you have an XML description of your objects, you can drag that into an   empty ReportMill document, to have access to ReportMill's powerful drag and   drop template design features (along with useful report previews). However,   you can choose to skip this step and simply enter all template keys by hand   (assuming you're familiar with the public methods and fields of the objects   in your target dataset). This is simply a matter of typing keys surrounded by   the @ sign: @title@.</p><p><strong>Generate Report</strong></p><p>The second and final step is to simply load and generate a report from your   target dataset:</p><p>RMDocument template = new RMDocument(aSource);<br>  RMDocument report = template.generateReport(myObjects);<br>  report.writePDF(&quot;MyReport.pdf&quot;);</p><p><strong>Using this JavaDoc</strong></p><p>This JavaDoc has been provided for those that choose to explore the lower levels   of ReportMill's functionality or those who have extraordinary reporting needs.   We recommend you start with the following classes:</p><p>RMDocument: This is generally the center piece of all ReportMill interaction.<br>  RMShape: This is the foundation of all graphic elements in ReportMill.<br>  RMText: This is the most common and most useful RMShape subclass.<br>  RMTable, RMTableRow: These are ReportMill's most powerful reporting elements<br>  RMXString: This is the basis for ReportMill's rich text system and represents   a String with attributes (font, color, etc.).<br>  RMFont, RMColor, RMFormat, RMParagraph: The most common RMXString attributes.</p></body></html>
